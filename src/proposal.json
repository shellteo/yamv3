        "body": "Summary:\nThis proposal would eliminate the 1 million YAM Community fund from YIP-1 bringing the YAM supply back to the original 5 million YAMs.\n\nMotivations:\n-The 1 million YAM community fund immediately increases YAM supply by 20% from the original YAM v1 supply of 5 million.  This sudden increase in supply is bearish for YAM prices and unnecessary.\n-YAM already has a treasury with which it can fund all of the same endeavors that the community fund can, while at the same time not increasing YAM supply.\n-Using the treasury forces fiscal responsibility on day 1 in that the community will only be spending funds it has accumulated in the treasury rather than funding endeavors with additional inflation.\n-YAM v1 treasury was able to accumulate almost $1 million in yCRV in the first 2 rebases.  There will likely be enough funds available in the treasury to fund endeavors after a few positive rebases without needing a separate slush fund."

        "body": "This proposal, if ratified, would redirect 1% of all inflows to the treasury to a [Gitcoin Grants Wallet](https://etherscan.io/address/0x232C95A72F132392171831cEcEc8c1161975c398), in order to support public goods in the Ethereum ecosystem. If ratified, every funding from the YAM treasury that went to the Gitcoin Grants wallet would be 100% used for public goods funding for the Ethereum ecosystem.  This funding would be allocated to the [*Tech* Grants](https://gitcoin.co/grants/tech?) category.\n\nThis proposal was motivated by [a tweet from Nick Dodson](https://twitter.com/iamnickdodson/status/1294264371489767424?s=21 ).  There is plenty of discussion on that thread to checkout as you weigh your votes.\n\nFor the uninitiated, Gitcoin Grants is like a crypto-style patreon, powered by [Quadratic Funding](https://wtfisqf.com), that has [delivered over $2.5mm of funding to Ethereum projects since Jan 2019](https://gitcoin.co/results).  For more on Gitcoin, checkout these reviews of Gitcoin Grants and QF \n- [Round 3 Review](https://vitalik.ca/general/2019/10/24/gitcoin.html)\n- [Round 4 Review](https://vitalik.ca/general/2020/01/28/round4.html)\n- [Round 5 Reveiew](https://vitalik.ca/general/2020/04/30/round5.html)\n- [Round 6 Review](https://vitalik.ca/general/2020/07/21/round6.html)\n\nThere are many promising projects in the community that support public goods (like ETH1/ETH2 development, L2 research, media, education, etc).  Given Gitcoin's long history of successfully supporting public goods on Ethereum at scale, without being captured, through a tough bear market, I believe Gitcoin is the strongest contender at the current moment, in this category.\n\nThere are two main reasons that I believe this is a good idea for the YAM community:\n1.  **Karma** -- Gitcoin Grants played a part in funding the transition form v1 => v2 [see this link](https://gitcoin.co/grants/1059/yam-protocol-audit). \n2. **High ROI Community Goodwill & Publicity**.  We can shift the narrative around YAMs being a \"degen\" project to having some \"regen\" effects to the ecosystem, like funding the base layer upon which it depends.  This will make YAMs part of the broader conversation around [rainbow colored money](https://thedefiant.substack.com/p/rainbow-colored-money-the-story-behind) in the Ethereum ecosystem, and public goods funding in the information age.\n\nIf this proposal passes, I will commit to the following:\n1. 100% of the tokens that go to this wallet from the YAM contracts will be sent to public goods (minus gas fees, which I expect to be fairly negligible).\n2. Prominently listing YAMs as a co-funder of Gitcoin Grants Rounds, for each round it contributes funding.\n3. I would be happy to provide a report back to the YAM community on where the YAM funds went, once per quarter, for every quarter in which the value that the YAM system provided to Gitcoin Grants was more than $10k USD.\n\nI appreciate the consideration that the community has given to this proposal\nGitcoin Founder, [Kevin Owocki](https://twitter.com/owocki)"

Should this proposal be passed, past and future proposals that do not conform to these mechanics will be considered invalid.\n\nWhile the original launchers of Yam will be submitting proposals, this framework is intended to make clear that anyone meeting the minimum requirements is able to submit proposals, some of which may supersede ours. The power and value of YAM lies in the YAM community, and we are excited to see what the community brings to the table in this interim period and in YAMv3.\n\nIt should be noted that any proposal may not be implemented without approval from the YAM community. \n\nWe're also thrilled and humbled by the support we've received from many in the DeFi community that have rallied behind us. One special shout out we'd like to give is to the Balancer and Snapshot Labs teams who built and are hosting this governance portal. This was something they did not have to do but graciously offered as we sought ways to limit our influence over this process.\n\nItem 1:\n\nWe propose a 3 day minimum voting period, with a maximum voting period of 7 days. This will ensure tokenholders have adequate time to assess proposals and vote, while also ensuring an efficient process.\n\nItem 2:\n\nWe propose all proposals must have a deadline prior to September 7, 2020, to ensure adequate time for code implementation prior to audit. This means the latest that a proposal can be submitted is September 4, 2020.\n\nItem 3:\n\nWe propose that all proposals not approved by the deadline must be resubmitted in YAMv3 governance to be considered for implementation.\n\nItem 4: \n\nWe propose that a minimum of 100 YAMv2 be required to submit a proposal. This is to prevent proposal overload and ensure an efficient V2 to V3 governance process.\n\nItem 5:\n\nWe propose to utilize the 4% quorum requirement initially set in V1 for approval of YAMv2 governance decisions.\n\nItem 6:\n\nWe propose that when submitting a proposal, a block height for a snapshot of balances must be chosen. The snapshot of balances will serve as ground truth for voting power. This block must be the current block at the time of proposal start time (+/- 15 minutes). Any proposal found not to do this will be disregarded and considered invalid, even if it achieves sufficient votes.\n\nItem 7:\n\nWe propose that in the event of conflicting approved proposals, priority will be given to the proposal that was approved most recently. \n"

        "body": "rentElmore，BrockElmore，WillPrice，ClintonBembry和DanElitzer在过去两周与YAM社区的讨论基础上，提出了以下措施以启动YAMv3。我们提交此提案的动机是为了确保从V2到V3的有效过渡，以最公平的方式解决关键任务问题，以尽可能多的社区参与。我们认为这是前进的最佳途径，但这取决于社区，这不是详尽的可能变更清单，而且我们确实希望提交其他提案。\n\n如提案力学提案中所述，任何人都可以提交其他提案，这些提案可能会取代和/或重复以下内容。\n\n第1项：次要协议更新\n\n我们提出以下协议更新。尽管有许多关于如何改进Yam协议的想法，但是我们发现谨慎的做法是集中精力在较小的更新上，以有限的开销改进V1。\n\n将储备资产更新为yUSD（yyCRV），其收益潜力比yCRV高\n\n将UniswapV2上的YAMv1/yCRVsync（）调用替换为YAMv3/yUSDsync（）调用\n\n硬编码建议（重新设置基准值50K）和仲裁（重新设置基准值200k）阈值\n\n将投票期从3天改为2天，以便更快地进行治理\n\n完整审核功能齐全的YAMv3协议\n\n项目2：YAMv3奖励分配\n\n我们建议在YAMv3/yUSD（yyCRV）UniswapV2LP池上建立一个单一的养殖池。奖励的第一周将在V3发布后一小时开始，总计330,000YAMv3。每周将减少30％的奖励，从而将总共1.1毫米的YAMv3代币分发给利益相关者。\n\n我们还提出了1MMYAMv3社区基金，该基金在储备金以外的单独社区基金合同中持有。该基金将由V3治理机构控制，不会影响投票的法定人数，并且可以在社区认为合适的情况下使用。用途可能包括但不限于新的激励池或生态系统发展计划。\n\nTL;DR：\nYAM/yUSDLP激励性权益池，每周初始发行33万YAMv3，每周减少30％，总计110万。\n\n1MMYAMv3社区基金\n\n第3项：从YAMv2到YAMv3的迁移\n\n我们建议YAMv2持有者进行1：1迁移。将创建无期限的迁移合同，该合同将允许YAMv2持有人燃烧其YAMv2令牌，以换取YAMv3令牌。\n\nTL;DR：\n通过迁移合同从V2到V31：1迁移\n\n项目4：委托人奖励\n\n我们建议利用在#saveyam治理提议时拍摄的快照，以利用“扁平且按比例缩放”的奖励模型来奖励代表。可以在这里找到代理人列表：https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yam-finance/yam-protocol/master/yam_delegator_snapshot_10650187_draft.json这些奖励还将用于通过以下计算将YAMv3的总供应量推算为整数：\n\n（YAMv3总供给）-（社区基金）-（LP总池奖励）-（YAMv2总供给）=（委托人奖励）\n\n委托人的总奖励约为173,588.383YAMv3。我们建议将这些奖励的一半（大约86,794.192）平均分配给3,173名代表，向每个代表奖励大约27.354个YAMv3代币。其余的86,794.192个YAMv3代币将根据其在总投票中所占的百分比分配给代表。这种结构补偿了小额持有者的努力和产生的交易费，并补偿了所有持有者的比例影响。\n\n这些委托人奖励将完全归属于V3发布。\n\nTL;DR：\n\n大约173k的奖励，一半按比例平均分配给所有代表，一半按比例分配\n\n提案摘要：\n\nV3总供应量：6,000,000\n\n协议更新：\n\n将储备资产更新为yUSD（yyCRV），其收益潜力比yCRV高。\n\n在UniswapV2YAMv3/yUSD池上调用sync（）\n\n硬编码建议（50K）和仲裁（200K）阈值\n\n将投票期限从2天改为2天\n\n完整审核功能齐全的YAMv3协议\n\n农业和激励措施：\n\nYAM/yUSDLP池，接收330kYAMv3，每周减少30％，总计110万。\n\n1MYAMv3社区基金\n\n移民：\n\n从V2到V3的1：1迁移\n\n委托人奖励：\n\n大约173k的奖励，一半平均分配给所有代表，一半根据投票捐款的线性比例分配\n\n这项提议再次由最初发起YAM的个人提出，反映了我们对如何最好地进行的想法。最终，由YAM社区决定，并且满足最低要求的提案可能会取代或重复此提案。\n\n"
